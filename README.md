# LP Sign Out System
A *(now out of use)* system used to enable signing in and out of a boarding house in a boarding school.

System relies on updating a Google Sheet with relevant data after identifiying the user via PIN or fingerprint both stored in an encrypted database. Google Sheets then parses the data into useful sheets using Google Scripts.

Relies on [SecuGen Android SDK](http://www.secugen.com/products/sdk_pro.htm#android) and an attached [Hamster HSDU03P fingerprint scanner](http://www.secugen.com/products/php.htm).

Designed specifically for Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 N8000, but views should look normal on all 10.1" screens, mileage may vary with other screen sizes.

**Source code released purely for reference and is no longer maintained. All associated sheets are deactivated and IDs will lead to nowhere and cause the application to crash should it be run.**
